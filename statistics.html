   <p>Dhoni is a right-handed batsman and wicket-keeper.
     Dhoni is an unorthodox batsman who deviates from conventional coaching manuals to showcase his batting technique.
     Dhoni displays a proclivity for hitting full-length deliveries towards the Long-on, Long-off, and Midwicket regions, rather than the conventional Cover region.
      He plays pull shots and hook shots off short-pitched deliveries often putting pressure on the bowler to adjust their line and length accordingly.
       Dhoni holds the bat with a firm grip at the bottom of the handle, striking the ball with force and precision to clear the boundary.
       He is a powerful hitter of the ball and is one of the fastest men in running between the wickets.
        He plays the helicopter shot technique, taught to him by a fellow player and childhood friend Santosh Lal.
         As a batsman, he is recognised for his finishing skills in high-pressure situations.
     <br><br><br>
As a wicket-keeper, he has been praised for his fast reflexes behind the stumps while also being criticised for the lack of good technique.
He is known for his unorthodox captaincy, approachability and has earned a reputation of being a successful leader.
Dhoni is also known for his cool-headed demeanor on the field which has earned him the monicker "Captain cool".</p>
